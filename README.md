ðŸš€ Machine Learning-Powered App for Daily Well Production Accounting and Future Forecasting ðŸ“ˆ

Welcome to our project! I've contributed to the development of a sophisticated machine learning-powered application built in Python using the Streamlit framework. This app is specifically designed for daily well production accounting and future forecasting.

Key Features:

Flexibility for Users: Tailor your experience by choosing the number of training and test data points to precisely match your needs.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Empower yourself to optimize model performance with customizable hyperparameters, including the number of layers, activation functions, epochs, batch size, sequence size, and more.

Technologies Used:

Python: The core language for building the application.
Streamlit Framework: A powerful and user-friendly framework for creating interactive web applications with Python.
Machine Learning: Utilizing cutting-edge ML techniques to provide accurate production accounting and forecasting.
